                <h1>What does it solve?</h1>
                
                <p>One of the main issues in equalizer apps existing in the market is having a steep learning curve. Without some basic knowledge about sound, it is difficult to get the effects you desire out of an equalizer software. Predefined settings improve the situation, but often times, every user has a specific set of adjustments that works best for their hearing, and presets are not capable of achieving that.</p>

                <h1>How does it work?</h1>
                
                <p>In short, it simulates 'measuring' of one's hearing capabilities by guiding the user through an easy setup process. It plays two tones at different frequencies at the same decibal level, and the user tries to match the perceived volume of the two tones. This continues on for several pair of tones.
                <br><br>
                This approach works as the actual volume vs. the perceived volume differs from person to person. Even the frequency response curve of a standard human's listening is not flat, where we perceive lower frequencies as being softer than higher frequencies. By laying the setup process down into this simple comparison between two tones, the app is able to map out a sound profile that is specific to each user's hearing.</p>
