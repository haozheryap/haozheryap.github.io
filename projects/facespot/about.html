                <h1>FaceSpot</h1>
                <p>A Python program that utilizes deep learning with convolutional neural networks to perform detection of synthetically-generated DeepFake content (images or videos). The project was done as part of my final year project in university, and was carried out in a team of 3. Each member had their own (loosely-defined) role, and I was the main software developer of the team.

                <h1>What does it solve?</h1>
                
                <p>DeepFake is a technique of generating faked images and videos by swapping the face of a person onto another person's body in a convincing manner. It leverages machine learning to achieve this. Its recent soar of popularity has made it known to groups of people with malicious intents, and has been used for all kinds of morally-questionable purposes, e.g. pornography, political motives, slander, etc. This project aims to contribute a small step to solving the bigger problem.</p>

                <h1>How does it work?</h1>
                
                <p>Using face detection, image processing and machine learning techniques, the program takes in an input of either an image or video, then predicts if the content is genuine or is a fabrication of the DeepFake algorithm. It presents itself to a user in the form of a GUI program running on Ubuntu.
